Making Graphs For Your Assignments Has Never Been Easier


Yello!
Been really annoyed drawing graphs for courses by hand, and couldn't find a - or was lazy to find - a nice n simple graphing app.
So wrote down this script.
You just give coordinates, scales, labels, marker size, and pointers, and twill do the rest.
Modifications are coming to handle user-matlami, but this works. *i think* *fingers crossed* :p
